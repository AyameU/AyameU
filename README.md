### Hello there ... ðŸ‘‹

<br />
I'm a full-time IT student making the switch from design to development.
<br />
<br />

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning C#, Java, :coffee:script, SQL and Networking.
- ðŸ¤” I tried to learn Spring and Springboot over the break and I feel like I jumped out of the frying pan into the :fire:.
- ðŸ˜„ I enjoy ... having too many IDEs installed on my computer.
- :v: I'm planning on ... installing Linux on my desktop to see if it can compete with macOS.
