I'm a full-time IT student making the switch from graphic and web design to development.

From January to August 2022 I worked as a Software Developer Co-op at iQmetrix, doing cool things with .NET and Azure.
<br />
During summer 2021 🏝️ I worked as a Front-End Web Developer for the Province of Manitoba.
