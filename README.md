### Hello there ... 👋
###### ... General Kenobi ... 
<br />
<br />
I'm a full-time IT student making the switch from design to development.
<br />
Over the summer 🏝️ I've been working as a Front-End Web Developer for the Province of Manitoba.

- 🔭 Currently learning about Sass, Web Accessibility, :coffee:script, C#, Java, SQL and React.
- 😎 Move over Java! I have a new favourite language: C#.
- 🤔 I tried to learn Spring and Springboot over the break and I feel like I jumped out of the frying pan into the :fire:.
- 😄 I enjoy ... having too many IDEs installed on my computer.
- :v: I'm planning on ... installing Linux on my desktop to see if it can compete with macOS.
