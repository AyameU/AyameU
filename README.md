### Hello there ... 👋
###### ... General Kenobi ... 
<br />
<br />
I'm a former graphic designer and web designer, who pivoted into the IT industry.
<br />
I work for Manitoba Hydro, a power utility and provincial Crown Corporation. My current team works with Azure and Terraform. 
<br />
From January to August 2022 I worked as a Software Developer Co-op at iQmetrix, doing cool things with .NET and Azure.
<br />
During summer 2021 🏝️ I worked as a Front-End Web Developer for the Province of Manitoba.

- 🔭 Currently studying for the Azure Developer Associate certification.
- 😎 Move over Java! I have a new favourite language: C#.
- 😄 I enjoy ... having too many IDEs installed on my computer.
