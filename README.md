### Hello there ... 👋
###### ... General Kenobi ...

<br />
I'm a full-time IT student making the switch from graphic and web design to development.
<br />
<br />
Since January 2022 I've worked as a Software Developer Co-op at iQmetrix, doing cool things with .Net and Azure.
<br />
During summer 2021 🏝️ I worked as a Front-End Web Developer for the Province of Manitoba.

- 🔭 Currently learning about React, PHP, :coffee:script, C#, PL/SQL and MySQL.
- 😎 Move over Java! I have a new favourite language: C#.
- 😄 I enjoy ... having too many IDEs installed on my computer.
- :v: I'm planning on ... installing Linux on my desktop to see if it can compete with macOS.
